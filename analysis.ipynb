    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "### There turned out to be more Non-COMP SCI Majors taking COMP 110 than COMP SCI Majors. This could be due to many people from other majors that have an interest in Computer Science and would like to try out an intro course to see what it's all about.\n",
    "### The second part of my hypothesis was correct, there were in fact more people that would recommend the course than people who wouldn't. This is most likely due to the fact that the course was very well structured with great instructors, leaving many with a great first impression of Computer Science.\n",
    "### In conclusion, the first part of my hypothesis was wrong, there are not more COMP SCI Majors taking COMP 110 than Non-COMP SCI Majors. The second part of my hypothesis, however, was correct, there were more people that would recommend COMP 110 than people who wouldnâ€™t.\n"
